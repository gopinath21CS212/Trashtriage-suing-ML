        The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), commonly referred to as the Swachh Bharat Mission, is a
        cleanliness and sanitation campaign launched in India by the government. The campaign was officially launched on
        October 2, 2014, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, who advocated for cleanliness and
        sanitation.

        One of the main objectives of the Swachh Bharat Mission is to ensure proper waste management, and promote waste
        segregation across the country. The campaign aims to create a cleaner and healthier environment for all citizens
        of India.

        Key components of the Swachh Bharat Mission in terms of Waste Management include: <br>


        1. <strong>Behavioral Change:</strong> <br> The campaign emphasizes the need for behavioral change among
        citizens regarding sanitation and hygiene practices. It also promotes the use of proper waste disposal. <br>

        2. <strong>Waste Management:</strong> <br> The mission focuses on proper waste management, including waste
        segregation at source, recycling, and safe disposal of waste. <br>

        3. <strong>Cleanliness and Hygiene:</strong> <br> The campaign seeks to promote cleanliness and hygiene
        practices in schools, communities, public places, and workplaces. <br>

        4. <strong>Public Awareness:</strong> <br> Swachh Bharat Mission aims to create awareness about the importance
        of cleanliness and sanitation through various media campaigns, events, and programs. <br>

        5. <strong>Technology and Innovation:</strong> <br> The mission also encourages the use of technology and
        innovation to improve waste management infrastructure and monitoring the amout of waste generated. <br><br>

        The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a part of India's broader efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)
        set by the United Nations, which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation
        for all.
